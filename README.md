I take part in leetcode contests for fun 😁 and I'll post the solutions to every problem I solve in here.
C++ is my language of choice for this kind of problems. <br>
Note: there are a lot of bad software engineering practices like poor variable names, global variables, hacks, etc. which is the result of solving problems ASAP in a timed constest, just be aware of that.
